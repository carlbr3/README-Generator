  ## Description
  This repository is where I developed a command line application to quickly create a professional README for new projects.  It streamlines the process of creating a well-structured README file by prompting you with questions about your project. It then generates a README file with the information you provide. A well-documented README file is essential for sharing your project with others, making it easier for them to understand, use, and contribute to your work.
